Been working many nights within this world called tech. Sometimes I want to stop, but then a new field emerges having me to
say I can make it in tech to provide for my family. Really tired of the same ole same ole and want to make a change of lifestyle 
as well as make a change for the world. While learning this Linux info and diving deeper in cybersec, I see how importatant it is
to secure self in the digital world. Let's not waste any time and proceed. I will achieve this goal! 

It's my son Micah birthday.

Son, Daddy truly doing this for you and Nypie!

Love You For LIFE Because DEATH Never Exist!
